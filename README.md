- [Live Demo](https://avocados-3js.netlify.app)


## What’s Cooking? 🍳  
*Avocados* isn’t just a fruit—it’s a React-powered, Three.js-fueled 3D experiment where a silky-smooth avocado drifts across your screen like it’s defying gravity. This is modern web tech meets pure absurdity. Why? Because why *not*?

### Why It’s Ripe 🔥  
- **Floating Vibes**: A 3D avocado that glides with zero chill.  
- **Three.js x React**: 3D magic meets component bliss.  
- **Smooth Animation**: Buttery motion that’ll make you hungry.  
- **Styled Components**: Clean, lean, and green styling.  
- **Fast Build**: Whipped up in a month—proof of concept, perfected.  

## Skills I Sliced Up 🪓  
This little gem taught me:  
- `@react-three/fiber` for seamless 3D in React.  
- Three.js to sculpt and animate that sweet avocado.  
- React hooks and state to keep it all in sync.  
- Vite for a dev setup so fast it’s criminal.  
- Styled-components for that extra zest.  

## Live and Luscious 🌿  
Born in December 2024, *Avocados* is live, lean, and ready to roll. Deployed with Vite’s lightning build, it’s a quick-hit showcase of 3D web wizardry. Next up?  
- Texture upgrades (hello, realistic peel).  
- Maybe a guac recipe popup—why not?    

## Ingredients 🧪  
- **React + Three.js**: The core mashup.  
- **@react-three/fiber**: 3D made easy.  
- **Styled-Components**: Flavorful CSS-in-JS.  
- Check `package.json` for the full recipe!
